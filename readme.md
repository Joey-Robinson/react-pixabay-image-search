# react-pixabay-image-search

# Purpose:

I wanted to create a react app that was able to search the free image site, pixabay. Using their API I was able to create an app that displays images when a search is typed into the search bar.

# Usage:

First, you'll need to either copy the clone link near the top of repository information, or download the repository to a folder or directory.

Second, after you've done one or the other, you'll need to open that folder and have either your terminal or code editor open to that directory as well. Once you've done that, you'll need to type the following commands into the terminal of your choice:

```
npm install
```

After that, you'll need to type in this command:

```
npm start
```

Once both of those are done, you'll be able open your favorite web browser to 

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

and enjoy the react application.
